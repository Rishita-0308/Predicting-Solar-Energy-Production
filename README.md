# ☀️ Predicting Solar Energy Production

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting solar energy output using historical weather and production data. The goal is to build a machine learning model that helps improve energy planning, optimize grid integration, and support decision-making for sustainable energy management.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Solar energy production is highly dependent on weather conditions, which makes it difficult to predict accurately. A reliable forecasting model can help energy providers manage resources more efficiently and minimize reliance on non-renewable sources.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Feature engineering from time and weather data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends between solar output and temperature, humidity, etc.

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
   - Tuned hyperparameters for performance optimization

4. **Evaluation**
   - Used RMSE and R² score to evaluate model accuracy

## ✅ Results
- Achieved a reliable forecast model with [insert performance metric if available, e.g., R² = 0.87]
- Found temperature and solar irradiance to be key predictors
